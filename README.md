# React-router
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use React-router in my projects for the first time.

It is a simple single-page-application created using React and Redux (creating router, store, actions and reducers) displaying list of countries and basic information on a selected country.

The navigation panel is created basing on react-router module. The user can switch between pages without reloading the whole page.

The user can search for a country, delete it and there is also a pagination enabling changing the number of countries displayed per page.
